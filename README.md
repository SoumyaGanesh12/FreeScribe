# üéôÔ∏è FreeScribe ‚Äì In-Browser Transcription & Translation App

**FreeScribe** is a fully browser-based audio transcription and translation tool built with React and Web Workers. It enables users to record or upload audio, transcribe speech to text using machine learning models running locally in the browser, and translate the transcribed text into over 100 languages ‚Äî all without requiring any backend or API integration.

## Features

### Audio Input
- Record audio directly from the user's microphone using the MediaRecorder API
- Upload audio files in `.mp3` or `.wav` formats
- Display real-time recording duration

### Transcription
- Uses a browser-executed model based on **Whisper Tiny (English-only)** for speech-to-text conversion
- Processes audio into partial and final transcription results using chunked inference
- Visual loading indicators to show model readiness and transcription progress

### Translation
- Translates transcription into 100+ languages using Meta‚Äôs **NLLB-200 distilled model**
- Translation is fully client-side, executed in a separate Web Worker
- Language selection via dropdown with intuitive labels
- Partial updates and final translated output displayed dynamically

### Output Actions
- Copy transcription or translation to clipboard
- Download output as a `.txt` file
- Download recorded audio as `.webm` for offline access or reuse

### Interactive UI
- Responsive layout optimized for both desktop and mobile
- Animated loading bars using CSS keyframes
- Font Awesome icons and Tailwind transitions for an enhanced experience
